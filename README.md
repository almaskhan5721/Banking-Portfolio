### Aim of the project analysis
The primary objective of this project are as follows:
- Identify which region has the highest average account balance, and what is the value?
- Identify which customer has the highest net transaction amount, and what is their account type?
- Calculate how many transactions are there? And which occupation has the most transactions?

### Processes
  
- Step 1: Data Modeling
  Tools: PowerBI Data Model, DAX
  * Defined relationships between tables(Transactions, Accounts, Branches, Customers)
  * Created measures using DAX for key KPIs like Total Transaction Amount, Average Account Balance by Region, Net Transaction Amount per Customer and Transaction Count by Occupation.

- Step 2: Analysis and Dashboard Creation
  Tools: Power BI Visualization
  * Built interactive dashboards with filters, slicers and drill-through functionality.
  * Used Bar Chart: Show Total Transaction Amount by Transaction Type (Deposit vs. Withdrawal), Table: Display Region, BranchName, Average Account Balance, and Transaction Count.
  * Created KPI Cards: Total Transaction Amount, Average Account Balance by Region, Net Transaction Amount per Customer and Transaction Count by Occupation.
